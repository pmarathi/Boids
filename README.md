# Boids 

A program to simulate the flight of a flock of birds: [https://pmarathi3.github.io/Boids/](https://pmarathi.github.io/Boids/)

If you right click, the boids will swarm around the cursor.
If you left click, the boids will avoid the cursor.

This program was built using [P5](https://p5js.org/).

## TODO:
These are some potential upgrades that I may get around to doing:
- combine cohesion, alignment, and separation into one loop (it is currently inefficient)
- maybe change the boid asset?
